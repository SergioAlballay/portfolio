	"about": {
		"intro": "G'day! I'm Sergio, a cybersecurity-minded software quality engineer with 8+ years of experience turning chaos into quality. Born and raised in Chile, I moved to the US when I was 14 and recently made Australia my home about 2 years ago. Based in beautiful New South Wales, I've spent my career bridging the gap between \"it works on my machine\" and \"it works everywhere, securely, and at scale\".My multicultural journey has taken me from the factory floors of Mars Petcare to the cloud infrastructure of Western Governors University, always with one mission: ensuring software doesn't just work, but works brilliantly. I believe in automation, love Linux servers, and have an unhealthy obsession with making CI/CD pipelines purr like well-tuned engines. When I'm not hunting bugs or architecting test frameworks, you'll find me mentoring aspiring techies in my bilingual community programs, because great software is built by great teams.",
		"professionalSummary": "Results-driven Senior Software Quality Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing and leading enterprise-scale quality engineering programs. Proven record of transforming manual and siloed testing into highly automated, secure, and data-driven practices that accelerate delivery, improve reliability, and cut costs. Adept at bridging QA, DevOps, and cybersecurity disciplines, mentoring cross-functional teams, and embedding shift-left, risk-based, and CI/CD-first testing strategies across cloud-native and legacy ecosystems.",
